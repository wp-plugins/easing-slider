Riva Slider "Lite" is an easy to use slideshow plugin. Simple and lightweight, built with native WordPress functionality.

== Description ==

Riva Slider "Lite" is an extremely easy to use slideshow plugin for WordPress. It is built to be lightweight and simple, with absolutely no bloat. It comes with many great features, some of which include:

* Fully responsive & mobile ready
* Lightweight, weighing just 16kb minified including styling
* Bulk image uploading, integrated with new WordPress Media Library
* CSS3 transitions for ultra smooth playback
* Navigation arrows & pagination
* Preloading functionality on page load
* Easy to modify styling
* Developer friendly with built-in Javascript events
* Lots of actions & filters for custom functionality

Throughly tested on iPhone, iPad and multiple Android devices, Riva Slider "Lite" is the perfect solution for mobile slideshows. We've used CSS3 transitions to ensure ultra smooth transitions on all devices. The codebase is also extremely light (just 16kb), which is perfect for those concerned about page loading times.

We've also integrated the new WordPress Media Library workflow to provide a better media management experience. Bulk uploading images to your slideshow is now easy, requiring just a few clicks.

Last but not least, we've left plenty of opportunity for custom plugin modifications using the WordPress Action & Filter APIs. You can completely create your own external functionality, or modify the plugin to integrate perfectly with your current theme. Awesome!
